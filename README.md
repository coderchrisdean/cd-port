## Description

This is a portfolio assignment for the UC Berkeley Extension Coding Bootcamp. It is a simple website that displays my name, a logo I designed, and a short bio. It also contains links to my Contact Information.  This is not a final version of the project.  I have stopped and restarted several times because of flex-box issues and used Bootstrap to help create due to lack of time and other projects that I need to finish before the bootcamp is over.
